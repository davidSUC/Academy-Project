How to Run:
1) Check the pyhton file main.py, preprocessing.py, model_traning.py, and the corpora train-Spring2024.txt and test.txt are all in the same directory.
2) Run python3 or python main.py in the terminal from the directory


*The program will output 3 files:
	1. output.txt
	2. P_train.txt
	3. P_test.txt
All answer for the question is in output.txt
P_train.txt is the mapped version of train file
P_test.txt is the mapped version of test file
